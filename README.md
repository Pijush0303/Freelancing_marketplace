•	An escrow-based payment system ensures safe transactions and payment releases only after project approval.


1.2	Objective

The primary goal is to build a feature-rich freelancing marketplace that supports a wide variety of services, ensures secure communication and payment handling, and provides an intuitive user interface to enhance user experience.


1.3	Problem Definition

The platform addresses the following problems:
•	Inefficient communication between freelancers and clients in current systems.

Chapter 5: Feasibility Study



5.1 Technical Feasibility

Technologies like PHP, MySQL, and Bootstrap are well-suited to develop the platform, providing scalability and security. Real-time communication can be achieved using WebSockets or AJAX for seamless interactions.


5.2 Economical Feasibility

Using open-source technologies minimizes software licensing costs, and the platform can be hosted on affordable cloud providers like AWS or DigitalOcean.


5.3 Operational Feasibility

The platform is designed to be user-friendly, with intuitive navigation and minimal learning curves. Both freelancers and clients can quickly get accustomed to posting jobs, submitting proposals, and managing payments.


5.4 Schedule Feasibility

Development is planned over six months, with flexibility for updates and additional features during the post-launch phase.















Chapter 6: System Design

6.1 Data Flow Diagram (DFD)

The following shows the flow of data between clients, freelancers, administrators, and the system.
Plaintext

6.2 Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)


Entities:
•	User (Client/Freelancer): Contains information about both clients and freelancers (name, email, profile details).
•	Service: Represents the various freelance services offered (service name, description, price).
•	Project: Contains project details, posted by clients, and accepted by freelancers.
•	Payment: Manages transactions and escrow payments.


6.3 Use Case Diagram

Here is a visualization of the main interactions between users (clients and freelancers) and the system.














Chapter 7: Module Design



7.1 User Module

•	Client Registration/Login: Clients create accounts and can post projects with detailed specifications.
•	Freelancer Registration/Login: Freelancers sign up and create a detailed profile, which includes skills, portfolio, services offered, and pricing.
•	User Dashboard: A central location for both clients and freelancers to manage their jobs, view communication history, and track payments.


7.2 Search and Filtering Module

•	Advanced Search: Clients can filter freelancers based on categories, price, ratings, location, and availability.
•	Freelancer Portfolio Browsing: Clients can view past work and portfolios to assess freelancers before hiring.
•	Job Search for Freelancers: Freelancers can search for jobs based on their skill set, and apply by submitting bids.


7.3 Real-Time Communication Module

•	Messaging System: Real-time chat, integrated with notifications.
•	Project Management Interface: Freelancers and clients can exchange files, track project milestones, and set deadlines through an interactive dashboard.


7.4 Escrow Payment Module

•	Escrow System: Clients deposit the project amount in an escrow account, which is released to freelancers after project completion.
•	Refund Handling: If a project is not completed to satisfaction, clients can request refunds from the escrow.
•	Secure Payment Gateways: Integration with third-party payment services like PayPal or Stripe for handling transactions.


7.5 Review & Rating System
